**To the Evaluation Team:**  

Please find both my Week 7 (SQL Data Analysis) and Week 8 (GenAI Loan Assistant) submissions in this repository.

**Key Highlights of Included Work:**  
‚úî **Week 7 SQL Project**:  
   - Complex query optimization  
   - Data visualization  
   - Comprehensive analysis documentation  

‚úî **Week 8 GenAI Project**:  
   - Vector similarity search  
   - LLM-powered Q&A system  
   - Production-ready Streamlit interface  

Both projects include:  
- Complete source code  
- Detailed READMEs with setup instructions  
- Requirements files for easy reproduction  

I would be grateful for your consideration in evaluating both assignments. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need any clarification or additional materials.
