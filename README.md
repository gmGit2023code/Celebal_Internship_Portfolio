**Note Regarding Week 7 Submission:**  
I sincerely regret not submitting Week 7's work through the official portal by the deadline. The project was completed on time and is included here for full transparency. I've since implemented organizational measures to prevent such oversights.

Both projects are:  
✔ Fully functional  
✔ Thoroughly documented  
✔ Ready for demonstration  

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require:  
- Additional explanation of any implementation details  
- Live demonstration of either project  
- Supplementary materials
